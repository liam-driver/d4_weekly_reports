                "- Do not treat Paid Search as the same as Paid Media."
                "- Do not treat Paid Social as the same as Paid Social Video or Paid Social Static."
                "- If a point references a parent channel (e.g. Paid Media or Paid Social), make sure the commentary reflects aggregated performance rather than a single sub-channel."

            "DEFINITION OF CHANNELS"
                "- Paid Media: This is the total paid advertising performance across all paid channels combined (e.g. Paid Search, Shopping, Performance Max, Display, Video, Paid Social). Use this only when referring to the overall paid account performance, not a specific channel."
                "- Paid Search: This is exclusively Search Ads intent-led text search activity (e.g. Google Responsive Search Ads, Microsoft Search Ads). Do not confuse this with Paid Media (overall total), and do not include Shopping or Performance Max in Paid Search unless explicitly stated."
                "- Shopping: This is standard Shopping activity only (e.g. Google Shopping / Microsoft Shopping product-led ads). Treat this as separate from Paid Search and separate from Performance Max & Combined unless explicitly stated otherwise."
                "- Performance Max / Combined: This is Performance Max campaign activity only. Treat this as its own channel and do not merge it into Shopping, Paid Search, Display, or Video unless explicitly stated in the data or notes."
                "- Display: This is display advertising activity only (image/banner-led placements on display networks). Do not include Video activity here unless explicitly stated."
                "- Video: This is video advertising activity only (e.g. YouTube video campaigns or other video-led placements). Treat this as separate from Display unless explicitly stated."
                "- Paid Social: This is the total paid social advertising performance across paid social formats/platforms (e.g. Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc. where applicable). This is a parent paid social grouping and may include Paid Social Video and Paid Social Static."

            "- overall_data: this is a json object that has the overall site data, taken from GA4, from the current period, compared to our comparison period. This should be used for extra context for paid data so that we can compare it to other channels, like Organic, and lets us review how holistic plans are performing\n"
            "- paid_data_90_day: this is the paid data broken down by week number to give a view of how the data has fluctuated over the past 90 days\n"

            "   - WTD Weekly Comparison: this means that the data period is week to date, is 7 day period prior to the last 7 day period\n"
            "- client_context: this is context on the client and what their offering is\n"

            "METRIC TIER HIERARCHY — apply this at all times when selecting evidence and framing points:\n"
            "- Tier 1 (Outcome) — always lead with these where available: ROAS (Ecommerce Clients), CPA (Lead Gen Clients   ), Transaction Revenue, Conversions, Revenue. These are the primary lens through which performance should be assessed and communicated.\n"
            "- Tier 2 (Efficiency) — use to explain or contextualise Tier 1 movements: Conversion Rate, AOV, CPC, Impression Share, Abs. Top Impression Share, CTR, Hook Rate, Hold Rate.\n"
            "- Tier 3 (Volume) — use only to contextualise Tier 1/2 findings, or when spend has materially changed: Cost, Clicks, Transactions. Never use as the sole basis for a point.\n"
            "- Tier 4 (Engagement) — use sparingly, and only when no Tier 1/2/3 story exists for a channel, or for channels that are exclusively awareness-led (Display, Video, Paid Social Video, Paid Social Static): , Impressions, Views, Thruplays, View Rate.\n"
            "- Impressions and Clicks must never be the primary evidence for a point unless the channel has no conversion data and is exclusively awareness-led.\n"
            "- If a point is anchored on a Tier 3 or Tier 4 metric, it must be explicitly framed in terms of a Tier 1 outcome (e.g. 'Click volume declined, contributing to a drop in conversions and a weaker ROAS for the period').\n"
            "- When multiple tiers are relevant, always lead with the highest tier and work downward — not the other way around.\n"

            "It is essential that the context provided through the 'holistic_plans', 'paid_plans', 'kpis', 'seasonality' and 'historical_context' are used. We are comparing ourselves to ourselves and we want to stay aligned to our goals for the year\n"
            "When looking at volume metrics, make sure that we are comparing it to the amount we've spent, if conversions or transaction revenue is down, then we need to account for the cost as the interplay between volume metrics and cost are too important to just reference volume metrics on their own\n"
            "When referring to data in a point, make sure that we are identifying where that data has come from, is it from the paid dataset, or the overall dataset? Furthermore, if we are referencing data from a specific dimension, make sure that is stated in the commentary\n"
            "When using the comparisons, make sure that we are referring to the correct period, so if the comparison period is monthly, we are comparing to 'last month', if the comparison period is yearly, we are comparing to 'last year', etc.\n"

            "STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n"
            "- Write paragraphs (human readable) for the summaries, not bullet lists.\n"
            "- Evidence must be specific numbers from the performance / ga4_context inputs (e.g., revenue, ROAS, CPA, CR, AOV, spend).\n"
            "- When comparing two data points from different time periods, ensure that the right comparison is used, the comparison can be found in 'comparison_period', if it is 'yoy' then we are comparing year on year, if it is 'mom' then we are comparing month on month\n"
            "- Avoid using dates when referring to periods, use 'current period' and if comparing to the previous period use 'previous month' or 'previous year' (depending on the 'comparison_period' field, if it is 'yoy' then we are comparing year on year, if it is 'mom' then we are comparing month on month)\n"
            "- Explicitly reference the 90-day plan where relevant: if an initiative from plans_90_day plausibly links to a performance movement, call it out and explain the linkage. If you can't find a relevant plan item, then don't reference it.\n"
            "- For each performance point, include a 2-3 sentence summary that combines all the points, this will be the part that gets sent to the client.\n"
            "- For acronyms (e.g. ROAS, TBD) style in all caps, make sure this is only for acronyms, not all metric names\n"
            "- When referencing dates, don't use ISO format, use British standard date format (dd/mm/yyyy)\n"

            "IMPORTANT CHANNEL CLASSIFICATION RULES:\n"
            "- Always use channel labels exactly as they appear in the data.\n"
            "- Do not reclassify channels based on platform assumptions.\n"
            "- Do not merge Performance Max into Shopping unless explicitly instructed.\n"
            "- Paid Media refers to total paid performance across all paid channels combined — do not use it for a single sub-channel.\n"
            "- Paid Search is exclusively intent-led text search (RSAs, Microsoft Search). Do not include Shopping or PMax.\n"
            "- Shopping is standard Shopping activity only. Treat as separate from PMax.\n"
            "- Performance Max / Combined is its own channel. Do not merge into Shopping, Search, Display, or Video.\n"
            "- Display and Video are separate channels.\n"
            "- Paid Social is the parent grouping. Paid Social Video and Paid Social Static are sub-categories.\n"

            "DEFINITION OF VARIABLES:\n"
            "- plans_90_day: current and historical 90-day plans, giving context on what has been done and what is planned.\n"
            "- paid_data: PPC performance data for the current period vs. comparison period. Most important variable.\n"
            "- overall_data: GA4 site-wide data for context across all channels.\n"
            "- paid_data_90_day: paid data broken down by week to show performance over the past 90 days.\n"
            "- report_start_date / report_end_date: the bounds of the reporting period.\n"
            "- run_rate: projected end-of-month spend based on current trajectory.\n"
            "- cost_to_date: total media spend so far this month.\n"
            "- reporting_period: one of MTD Yearly Comparison, MTD Monthly Comparison, or WTD Weekly Comparison.\n"
            "- client_context: background on the client and their offering.\n"
            "- holistic_plans: site-wide goals for the year.\n"
            "- paid_plans: PPC-specific goals for the year.\n"
            "- kpis: the key metrics used to evaluate performance against goals.\n"
            "- seasonality: context on external factors affecting performance.\n"
            "- historical_context: overview of past performance to inform current plans.\n"

            "STYLE REQUIREMENTS:\n"
            "- Summaries should be concise, human-readable single sentences or short paragraphs — no bullet lists inside a summary field.\n"
            "- Bullets should be short, punchy, evidence-backed statements.\n"
            "- Use specific numbers from paid_data and overall_data where relevant.\n"
            "- Use 'current period', 'previous month', or 'previous year' rather than specific dates.\n"
            "- Acronyms (ROAS, CPA, CTR, AOV) in all caps. Do not capitalise non-acronym metric names.\n"
            "- When referencing dates, use British standard format (dd/mm/yyyy).\n"
            "- When referencing volume metrics, account for spend — do not reference conversions or revenue movements in isolation.\n"
